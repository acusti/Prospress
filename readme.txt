Add an auction marketplace to your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Prospress is a new plugin that goes where no plugin has gone before.

After its 30 second install, your WordPress site will have its very own auction marketplace. Your registered users will be able to post auctions, place bids, provide feedback and make payments. Everything needed for a fully functioning marketplace.

One caveat - Prospress is so new, it's still in beta. So please only use Prospress on test sites for now. There will be bugs. Those bugs will be fixed, but it's better they occur in a sandbox.

= Why is Prospress here when it's beta? =

For those who can't wait to try a game changer, this beta is for you. Download, install & explore what you'll soon be able to do with WordPress, but please do so on a test site.

If you'd prefer to wait for a stable release, we've made a special [demo site](http://demo.prospress.org/auctions/) for you. You can register, post auctions & make bids on some priceless paintings in the safety of a Prospress.org sandbox.

= Want to know more? =

Read the plugin's [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/prospress/faq/) or visit the project's site - [Prospress.org](http://prospress.org).

= Get Involved =

To hasten the official release of Prospress, or just help give the world a free and open marketplace platform, you can [contribute](http://prospress.org/contribute) to the Prospress project.


== Installation ==

1. Upload everything into the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory of your installation.
2. Activate Prospress in the "Plugins" admin panel.

Just because Prospress does so much doesn't mean its installation should be tough.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If you have a question not answered here, please ask in the Prospress [support forums](http://prospress.org/forums).

= Is this an auction site in a box? =

Yep. You can pretty much create your own eBay, right along side your existing WordPress site.

= Do I need a special theme to use Prospress? =

Prospress attempts to work out of the box with your existing theme. 

Due to the gamut of themes, it's not possible to support all themes, so the built-in templates may display with quirks. If this happens on your site, not to worry, you can add two custom template files to your theme's directory - `index-auctions.php` and `single-auction.php`.

If you're comfortable with HTML/CSS, check out the `pp-index-auctions.php` and `pp-single-auction.php` for a guide. It's really quite easy to make your own templates. 

If you need help, make a post in the Prospress [Theme Compatibility forum](http://prospress.org/forums/forum/theme-compatibility). 

= Where do I view Auctions? =

Prospress creates it's own special index page, called `Auctions`. Visit this page to view the list of your auctions.

= Can any registered user post an auction? =

That's entirely up to you. All registered users will be able to place bids and make payments, but you control who can post auctions. 

You can host auctions from a privileged few or allow your entire community to trade items. Set permissions under the `Prospress | General Settings` admin menu.

= Is this stable enough for use on my live site? =

Not yet. Prospress is a major plugin that has been in development for some time. It's been tested on a variety of setups, but never in production. 

There will be bugs. Those bugs will be fixed, but it's better they occur in a sandbox.

Please download & explore Prospress in a test environment, but wait until a non-beta release before using on your live site. 

If you'd prefer to wait for a stable release, we've made a <a href="http://demo.prospress.org/">demo site</a>.

If you want to hasten the official release of Prospress, you can help by [contributing](http://prospress.org/contribute) to the project.

= Where can I get support? =

In the Prospress [support forums](http://prospress.org/forums "Prospress Forums").

= Where can I find documentation? =

Don't you hate it when you can't learn how to use new software? So do we, which is why Prospress *will* have a codex. But at this stage, too many hours have been consumed writing code, leaving too few for writing documentation.

If have a knack for learning new software, and could improve this sentence, you can help document Prospress. [Contact us](http://prospress.org/contact "Prospress Contact Page") to get an early-stage author account for the Prospress Codex.

= Where can I report a bug? =

Please report bugs in the Prospress [Bug Report forum](http://prospress.org/forums/forum/bug-reports "Prospress Bug Report Forum").

= Where can I try the latest? =

During beta, regular updates will be made. But if you can't wait, Prospress is hosted in a git repository at [GitHub](git@github.com:Prospress/Prospress.git "Prospress GitHub Project"). GitHub is also the primary development site for the project.

If your dreams occasionally contain curly braces, and you want to help give the world a free and open marketplace platform, you can contribute to the Prospress code base on GitHub.

GitHub makes it easy to contribute. They also have great [documentation](http://help.github.com/ "GitHub Documentation") and [getting started guides](http://help.github.com/ "GitHub Getting Started Docs") for how to contribute and use Git.

= Is that it? =

Nope. There are a few surprises but you'll have to download & explore Prospress to find them.


== Screenshots ==

1. **Add an Auction** - Publishing an auction is just like publishing a post, except you also need to add a start price and end date.
2. **Give Feedback** - When an auction completes, the two parties can provide feedback for each other.
3. **Set Capabilities** - All registered users can make bids & payments, but admins can choose which roles can publish & edit auctions.
