Prosper with Wordpress - create an online marketplace.

== Description ==

Technically, Prospress is a suite of WordPress plugins and themes. 

But really, Prospress is a dream. The dream to do for marketplaces what WordPress did for communication - make it easy and free (as in beer and liberty).

Prospress provides all the power-packed simplicity you've come to love of WordPress, with a marketplace twist.

All Prospress plugins can be themed to match your own style, in just the same way as a WordPress blog. 
The Prospress plugins are bundled with a default theme to get you going out of the box.

All existing themes work with Prospress, though to make the most of it, they should use an additional template tag or two to all visitors to bid or watch posts.

== Installation ==

For best results, Prospress should be installed on a new WordPress installation. Prospress extends the core post system in WordPress, meaning, if you have existing posts, there will be some funky behaviour.

That said, installing on an existing blog won't damage any of your entries. Even if you deactivate or delete it.

--- Plugins: ---

1. Upload everything into the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory of your installation.
2. Activate Prospress in the "Plugins" admin panel using the "Activate Site Wide" or "Activate" link (both work).

--- Themes: ---

1. Move the "/wp-content/plugins/prospress/golden-glove/" directory to "/wp-content/themes/"

This default theme is not required, but it makes the marketplace a whole lot nicer to use.

--- Upgrading from an earlier version: ---

1. Backup!
2. Overwrite the /plugins/prospress/ directory with the latest version.
3. If you are using the default themes, overwrite them using the new versions in the /plugins/prospress/
directory. If you are using your own custom themes, they will continue to work with no changes needed.
